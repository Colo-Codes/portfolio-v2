                        <p>This project was one of my favourite tools for breaking my way out of tutorial hell ðŸ‘¹. I also wanted this project to serve me as a display of my JavaScript skills to potential employers or collaborators.</p>

                        <p>By the time I decided to start working on this project I had just finished learning about Promises, async...await, APIs and error handling. I wanted to code a project to implement all of this knowledge.</p>

                        <p>At the start, this project seemed simple, but it quickly got complicated, especially because I was dealing with three different APIs (and a couple more that didnâ€™t work in the end).</p>

                    <ParagraphLight>
                        <p>I didnâ€™t spend much time on HTML, but CSS proved to be demanding once more ðŸ˜…. Thanks to the challenges I faced I gain more CSS skills and learned how to better debug it.</p>

                        <p>Regarding JavaScript, I could have implemented MVC from the get-go, so I will do that in my next project. As I previously said, I prefer not to refactor this project and leave it as a witness of my skills at the time.</p>

                        <p>APIs are reliableâ€¦ most of the time ðŸ¤­. Iâ€™m sure paid APIs perform better, so if I need to use them in the future for a more serious project, I will research deeply what is the best API to get for the job.</p>

                        <p>This project still has room for improvement, but I had to make the decision to stop working on it at some point. Overall, I think itâ€™s functioning as expected.</p>

                        <p>Doing courses and tutorials is great, but sometimes is difficult to evaluate how much are we actually learning. Watching video after video and coding along with the instructor gives us very good guidance, but it is not a realistic scenario. In a real-world job, we will have to solve problems and start figuring things out by ourselves (with the help of Google, of course ðŸ˜‰). So, to test how much I was actually learning during the JavaScript course I was doing I decided to make a simple To-Do app in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>I learned about the importance of structuring HTML in a meaningful semantic way, and how a good HTML structure can make our lives easy when we start working on CSS and JavaScript in later stages of the project.</p>

                        <p>I underestimated CSS ðŸ˜…. The classes names are a bit funny and messy, so in the future, I'll try to implement BEM notation and maybe SASS. I discovered that some behaviour that initially thought of was in the realm of JavaScript can easily be achieved with CSS, such as animations on elements.</p>

                        <p>Regarding JavaScript, this was the first time I coded following the OOP paradigm and, despite feeling a bit out of my element, I now can see the potential that following this paradigm has.</p>

                        <p>The project has a lot of room for improvement, but I wanted to live it like that to have a "snapshot" of my knowledge and skills up to the point in time where I was working on it.</p>
